# Heaps: Huffman Encoding

Huffman Encoding is a popular algorithm used in text compression. The
technique revolves around the use of a Priority Queue (Heap) and Binary
Tree in order to achieve an optimal compression for static text.

# Overview

In this lab, you will implement the Huffman algorithm to compress (and
decompress for bonus) text files. Your program should be able to read in a
text file chosen by the user and compress it to an appropriate file which the
user should also choose.

# Concepts

- Generics with Requirements
- Priority Queues
- Binary Trees
- File Input and Output

# Program Details

- The program must be entirely console based and accept command-
    line arguments. -o<outputfile>indicate the file to create. The last
    command-line argument is the file to decompress. For example, java
    program.class -o output.txt input.txt will read from the file input.txt
    and output to the file output.txt.
- There must be a clear separation of presentation (file I/O, console I/O,
    etc) and logic (Heap, Huffman Encoder/Decoder, Graphics, etc).
- The output file must contain a Text Representation of the Huffman
    Dictionary.


- The program must be able to handle compression up to the Huffman
    Dictionary.
- Java-doc style comments are required forallnon-private method and
    variables. For private variables, commenting is required if the code is
    confusing or not self-documenting.

# Bonus

```
Compress the file all the way to binary and then allow for decompressing
the file.
```
- Store the tree in binary prior to the message.
- Add an End Token at the end of the message
- Add a -d command-line argument to indicate that youâ€™re decoding
    the input file. You can also attempt to auto-detect what to do
    based on the data in the file!

# Some Hints

1. Design your classes first! The scoring guide will help.
2. Deal with andtestcompression without file output first! Then deal
    with file output. Then move on to decompression (in the reverse order).
3. Remember that compressed data is BINARY and cannot be handled
    exactly like text. (Use BitSet, byte[], bit shift operators, etc). Research
    (read: Google) how to deal with binary data in Java.
